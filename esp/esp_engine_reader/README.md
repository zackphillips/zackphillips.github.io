# SensESP Project Template

This repository provides a template for [SensESP](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/) projects.
Fork, clone or download the repository and try building and uploading the project to an ESP32 device.
You should immediately see output on the serial monitor! Similarly, you should be able to connect to
the WiFi access point with the same name as the device. The password is `thisisfine`.

To customize the template for your own purposes, edit the `src/main.cpp` and `platformio.ini` files.

Comprehensive documentation for SensESP, including how to get started with your own project, is available at the [SensESP documentation site](https://signalk.org/SensESP/).
