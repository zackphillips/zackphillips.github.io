  // ── Classification thresholds ────────────────────────────────────────────
  // There are none, deliberately. Battery, tank, anchor and packet-loss
  // thresholds used to live here as twelve constants, which meant every boat
  // publishing this site agreed that 45% state of charge is "Low" and a tank
  // under 20% needs refilling. Those numbers belong to a battery bank and a
  // tank, not to a dashboard: 45% is comfortable on 600Ah of LiFePO4 and
  // nearly flat on a tired 200Ah of AGM.
  //
  // The boat already knows. Signal K carries `meta.zones` on every path —
  // `[{lower, upper, state, message}]`, set on the server's Data Fiddler page
  // or by the plugin that owns the sensor — and the server is where an alarm
  // is configured anyway, so a threshold set here would be a second answer
  // that disagrees with the first one silently. app.js reads the zones off
  // the published snapshot and paints from those alone; a path with no zones
  // set renders uncoloured, the same way an unknown position renders as
  // unknown rather than as San Francisco.

  // ── Data display ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Upper bound on points drawn in one sparkline, not a window. The window is
  // chosen from HISTORY_WINDOWS; this only stops a very long, very fine log
  // from queueing tens of thousands of lineTo calls per card for sub-pixel
  // detail nobody can see. A card is at most ~400 CSS px wide.
  SPARKLINE_MAX_POINTS:     2000,
  DEFAULT_RECENT_TRACK_COUNT:  3,   // coloured track days shown by default

  // How far back the sparklines plot, offered in the panel header once
  // history is shown. What is actually selectable depends on the published
  // log: instrument_log.json covers `entries x resolution` (both set on the
  // plugin config page), and a window longer than that would draw the same
  // chart as the longest one that fits, so the frontend disables it rather
  // than pretending. Defaults to the shortest, which every log covers.

  // fallback tide location in San Francisco Bay, which any site that had not
  // published its site config yet showed as its own. Unknown renders as
  // unknown — privacy_zones and default_location come from site.json or they
  // do not come at all.

  // this alone is what keeps edits gated to contributors.
